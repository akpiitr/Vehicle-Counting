# Vehicle-Counting

Here I have used Background Substraction to detect vehicles and then I have used some morphological transformation for a better accuracy.

This is for only static cameras. 

At the corner of the video you can see the count of the vehicles which gets recorded when they cross a predefined limit. For the calculation of the object coordinates and object id's I defined a class called "vehicles.py"

For running it, just download all files and run the main.py
Thank you.
